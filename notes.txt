The remote release interface is incredibly simple - just a 2.5mm stereo
headphone socket. Short the base and ring to initiate AF, and short the base
and tip to fire the shutter. Hold the base and tip shorted for a bulb
exposure. So it is fairly basic electronics to make a timer to control
these. The slightly more complicated electronics is determined by how much
control you want to have over the timer functions.


Green = tip
Red = ring (?)
Copper = base

~1.2V across tip and base
